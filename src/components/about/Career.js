                <p className="s-font">For the future, I plan to complete my kinesiology degree with a <a className="link" href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/current/programs/require/2018-2019/comptech_option.html" target="_blank">computing option</a> in order to expand my understanding of theory and core concepts such as data structures, algorithms, recursion, and more. By self-teaching code, many of these fundamentals can be missed out on or only lightly touched upon. Taking computer science courses will be beneficial to my overall understanding of the field and success whether it be during interview questions or simply working on side projects.</p>

                <p className="s-font">By studying Kinesiology I will acquire a profound understanding of physiological, biomechanical, and psychological dynamic principles and mechanisms of movement allowing me to innovate technology for the fitness and health industry in ways that a computer science or engineering graduate cannot.</p>
