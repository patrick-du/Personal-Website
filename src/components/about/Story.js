          Whenever I was asked about my future plans I immediately blurted out
          that I would be a physiotherapist. What else would you be doing in
          kinesiology otherwise? I mean besides applying for a prestigious
          medical school, becoming a chiropractor, personal trainer, or
          everyoneâ€™s favourite - a gym teacher.

          I portrayed myself as a confident and prepared student, when in
          reality I really had no idea what I wanted to do. On the other hand,
          all my friends seemed to have a clear-cut idea of what they wanted to
          do, the clubs they would join for experience, or the clinics they
          would volunteer at.

          Attending a school at the forefront of innovation means that I am
          constantly surrounded by studious individuals. Whether it was during
          the easy going summer term or the weeks leading up to finals, I
          constantly found friends working on side projects. In Kinesiology,
          there arenâ€™t many opportunities for side projects. My days would
          generally consist of studying, working out, and drinking protein
          shakes as you would expect.

          This was no different in the summer except there was no studying. In
          the time I should have spent studying, I was playing video games and
          rewatching every single Marvel movie leading up to Avengers: Infinity
          War (all 18 of them). I highly recommend - the interconnectivity of
          each film with their own distinct storylines and purposes is
          absolutely incredible.

          Remember how I said my friends were always working on side projects?
          In the same span of time, my roommate had just completed 2 coding
          courses, developed a mini game, made his resume, and was in the
          process of creating his second website. All I had done was watch
          movies, work out, and bought some new clothes...the least I could do
          was make my resume.{' '}

          When I checked out his portfolio it inspired me to create my own
          website, so based on his recommendation I took a beginner HTML5 and
          CSS3 course. By the end of the summer, I launched my{' '}

          Following this project, my passion for coding continued to sprout and
          with coop applications coming up I decided to take a stab at applying
          for a position I was in no way qualified for. With a combination of
          hard-work and lots of Tim Horton's coffee â˜• I was able to land an
          interview and secure a web developer position at{' '}

          for my first coop term. Since then, I have attended several hackathons
          and expanded my skill set immensely.
