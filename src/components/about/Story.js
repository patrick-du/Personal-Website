            <p className="s-font">Whenever I was asked about my future plans I immediately blurted out that I would be a physiotherapist. What else would you be doing in kinesiology otherwise? I mean besides applying for a prestigious medical school, becoming a chiropractor, personal trainer, or everyoneâ€™s favourite - a gym teacher.</p>
            <p className="s-font">I portrayed myself as a confident and prepared student, when in reality I really had no idea what I wanted to do. On the other hand, all my friends seemed to have a clear-cut idea of what they wanted to do, the clubs they would join for experience, or the clinics they would volunteer at.</p>
            <p className="s-font">Attending a school at the forefront of innovation means that I am constantly surrounded by studious individuals. Whether it was during the easy going summer term or the weeks leading up to finals, I constantly found friends working on side projects. In Kinesiology, there arenâ€™t many opportunities for side projects. My days would generally consist of studying, working out, and drinking protein shakes as you would expect.</p>
            <p className="s-font">This was no different in the summer except there was no studying. I dedicated that chunk of time for studying to playing video games and rewatching every single Marvel movie leading up to Avengers: Infinity War (all 18 of them). I highly recommend - the interconnectivity of each film with their own distinct storylines and purposes is absolutely incredible.</p>
            <p className="s-font">Remember how I said my friends were always working on side projects? In the same span of time, my roommate had just completed 2 coding courses, developed a mini game, made his resume, and was in the process of creating his second website. All I had done was watch movies, work out, and bought some new clothes...the least I could do was make my resume.  </p>

            <p className="s-font">When I checked out his portfolio it inspired me to create my own website, so based on his recommendation I took a beginner HTML5 and CSS3 course. By the end of the summer, I launched my <a className="hvr-underline-from-left purple" href="https://patrickdu.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">first website</a>!</p>

            <p className="s-font">Following this project, my passion for coding continued to sprout and with coop applications coming up I decided to take a stab at applying for a position I was in no way qualified for. With a combination of hard-work and lots of Tim Horton's coffee â˜• I was able to land an interview and secure a web developer position at <Link to="../../work" className="hvr-underline-from-left purple">FGF Brands</Link> for my first coop term. Since then, I have attended several hackathons and expanded my skill set immensely.</p>
