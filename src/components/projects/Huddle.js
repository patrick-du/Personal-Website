              A modern social media application that connects NFL fans while
              supporting local venues.

              The primary functionalities of Huddle are to allow fans to make
              picks, bet, and watch live games being streamed at local venues
              promoted by Huddle.

            <p className="general-font">
              As a team, we recognized that professional sports is an enormous
              product that can connect individuals regardless of age, gender, or
              race. We wanted to utilize the product of sports by coming up with
              a way to quantify its fan-fueled competitive aspect while selling
              it for what it really is, a social excitement.
            </p>
            <p className="general-font">
              Our brainstorming initially began with the concept of simply
              bringing fans together. However, we soon recognized that fans
              donâ€™t prioritize where they watch games, only who they watch with.
              This led us to the idea of promoting local venues, providing them
              with an opportunity to gain more customers while also helping us
              achieve our goal of connecting fans.{' '}
            </p>
            <p className="general-font">
              To provide a competitive aspect to the app, we implemented a user
              rating system based on their pick accuracy. Thus, inclining users
              to continue to use Huddle in order to broadcast their ability to
              correctly make picks.{' '}
